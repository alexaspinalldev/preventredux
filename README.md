## Introduction
"Prevent - What you need to know" is website created in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3 and Javascript designed to outline the basic facts of the UK's Prevent program. Prevent is a an initiative intended to spot and support people who may be vulnerable to radicalisation. Its goal is to recognise early signs of concern, raise awareness, and connect people with the right help and guidance before issues escalate.

## UX
### Scoping
In planning I started with establishing my user goals and personas:

**External User’s Goal:** The user wants a basic introduction to the Prevent strategy, including how to recognize signs of radicalization and how to report concerns presented in a simple, easy-to-navigate format.

**Site Owner’s Goal:** The site owner’s goal is to create an informative webpage that introduces the Prevent strategy. The content should be well-organised and easy to digest, with a focus on simplicity and clarity.

**User persona:** Members of the public looking for information, or wanting to report something they're concerned about.

### User stories
Below are the User Stories I completed during the project. Some are general initial requirements and some are requirements that developed at the project went on.

### Wireframes
I used Google Sheets as my wireframing tool as I'm most comfortable with that platform, and I could easily set up Bootstrap's 12-column width arrangement.

## Design
### Fonts
My primary font for all body text is Dongle - this was my second choice after my first font was deemed too staid. This font required modicum of manipulation as it came out very small, and increasing the size also added unwanted line height.

My secondary font for all headings is Kanit chosen for its medium formality.

### Colours
I defined the following variables at the beginning of the project:
    --white: #F7EBE8;
    --black: #272727;
    --teal: #22AAA1;
    --red: #FDE467;
    --mint: #55FF99;

I used slightly off-shades of white and black in an experiment in breaking away from standard colours.

You'll see that my "red" variable ended up being a shade of yellow - this is a lesson for me on naming variables!

### Images
Images were sourced from [Freepik](freepik.com) and [SVG Repo](svgrepo.com).

My research into Prevent encouraged me to go down a more pastoral route, so I used images featuring people holding hands in connection, to underline than Prevent is about care and community.

### Favicons
My favicon is from an image generated by DALLE via ChatGPT, manipulated using [RealFaviconGenerator](realfavicongenerator.net). I was also able to use this as a bulletpoint.

### Content
All text content was generated by ChatGPT, with revisions designed to make the tone friendier and more informational.

## Features
### Highly responsive layout
The website features what I consider to be a highly responsive layout with three different configurations depending on screen size. In particular, the mobile layout is designed to encourage downwards- scrolling using the snaking whitespace left by the assymetric paragraphs. Upon scaling up, the right-justified paragraph resolves to the left.

### Header image
Smaller screens also feature a header image better suited to the narrower form factor than the image used on wider screens. Quite elegantly, the header image is tinted using a CSS box-shadow inset and sized to cover the image entirely, allowing the text to stand out better.

<img src="assets/ReadMe/header-image.png" width="100%">

### Half-pill design
By adding rounded corners to the header element, I was able to create this half-pill design that appears to hang down from the navbar. I would have also liked to be able to echo this with the main-content div, having it appear to nest underneath the header, but did not have enough time. This design language is echoed on smaller screens where the \<section>s appear to attach limpet-like to the sides of the frame, and on medium screens fuse together.

<img src="assets/ReadMe/half-pill-design.png" width="30%">

### Contact form
The simple contact form includes a dropdown for the user to input what role they are enquiring from. This was informed by the concept that my site would primarily be used by caregivers, parents and people in roles of responsibility.

## Future scope
Further tweaks for this website will be to lessen the "primary" nature of the colours used in favour of a more closely grouped pallate.

Due to the timed element of this project I would like to be able to go back and improve the semantic layout of the site.

An idea I had that I did not have time to implement was to have the #maincontent section appear to sit behind the header, in a nested arrangement.

The overall tone of the site is a little mixed currently.

Finally, I am not satisfied with the amount of blank space shown on XL screen sizes - this is mainly a limitation of Bootstrap's columns which cannot be 50% width with this design.


## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 5.3
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts

## Deployment
The site is deployed to GitHub pages:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Testing
#### Manual testing
Testing on all screensizes revealed the sheer amount of whitespace and lack of content (seen in above screenshots) left the site looking sparse, and like a whiteboard. This was resolved in the closing stages of the project with a more muted background colour and additional content.

Testing showed that all breakpoints and media queries function as expected, save for the warning banner in the footer which required some finessing.

I found that the contact form was erroring due to it's method="post" attribute so I removed that for the sake of demonstration.

#### HTML validation
HTML validation via official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) returned 13 issues, of which 7 were non-critical or could be ignored. After resolving these, it passed with no further issues.

The "Thank you" page passed with zero issues.

#### CSS validation
CSS validation via official [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) returned zero issues.

#### Accessibility testing
Accessibility testing via [Wave](wave.webaim.org) returned 8 contrast warnings with my headers, which I decided to ignore, and one suggestion to correct a \<p> to a heading. This done, there were no further issues.

#### Lighthouse testing
Lighthouse testing on mobile in an incognito tab returned the following scores:

<img src="assets/ReadMe/lighthouse-mobile.png" width="300px">

The poor performance of the site is something I had noticed and can be attributed to large image files. The two header images are already compressed but I expect the one used on screens <768px wide could be reduced further.

Repeating the test for desktop form factor, the following score were shown:

<img src="assets/ReadMe/lighthouse-laptop.png" width="300px">

This is again attributable to large image loading and also the triple-responsive layouts available.

#### Unfixed bugs
I found in manual testing that, on mobile the ! bulletpoints sit on the second line, of their content when wrapped. This is due to them being placed as an ::after psuedo-class.

The \<select> element in the Contact form is a different height to the other fields - this is due to how I was required to scaled up my chosen font significantly.

The page anchors do not scroll to the correct place on the page - I believe this relates to my sticky navbar.
